# Serverless Service Alternatives Report

## Objective
This report compares key Microsoft Azure serverless services studied in the course with equivalent offerings in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The comparison covers features, triggers/bindings, integration options, monitoring, pricing, and an analysis of strengths and weaknesses.
